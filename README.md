====

Robust validation of options passed to Ruby methods.

Compatibility
-------------

Optionable is tested against MRI (1.9.2+), JRuby (1.7.0+), Rubinius (2.0.0+).

Installation
------------

With bundler, add the `optionable` gem to your `Gemfile`.

```ruby
gem "optionable",
```

Require the `optionable` gem in your application.

```ruby
require "optionable"
```

Usage
-----

Include the optional module in your object, and use the DSL for define what values
are valid for the specified options. Currently you can match on exact values or
values of a specific type. Then to validate your options, simply call `validate_strict`
and pass it the hash of options.

```ruby
class Parser
  include Optionable

  option(:streaming).allow(true, false)
  option(:timeout).allow(Optionable.any(Integer))

  def initialize(options = {})
    validate_strict(options)
  end
end
```

If the options are invalid, an `Optionable::Invalid` error will be raised.

If an unknown option is provided, an `Optionable::Unknown` error will be
raised.
